description: Clarify unclear ideas through collaborative dialogue
---

Turn unclear ideas into fully formed designs through one-question-at-a-time exploration.

## What This Does

1. Explores the idea through focused questions (one at a time)
2. Proposes 2-3 approaches with trade-offs
3. Validates design incrementally
4. Creates spec.md and research.md for the clarified feature

## When to Use

- You have an idea but haven't defined scope
- Requirements are unclear or exploratory
- Need to explore alternatives before committing

## Usage

```bash
/brainstorm
/brainstorm [idea-description]
```

## Invocation

Load the my-workflow skill and execute the brainstorm workflow:

```text
@skills/my-workflow/SKILL.md
@skills/my-workflow/workflows/brainstorm.md

Execute the /brainstorm workflow as documented.
```
