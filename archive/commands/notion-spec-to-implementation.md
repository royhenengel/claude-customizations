# Notion Spec to Implementation

Transform "$ARGUMENTS" specification into actionable implementation plan with tasks.

Invoke the notion-spec-to-implementation skill to:

1. Find and fetch the specification page from Notion
2. Parse functional/non-functional requirements and acceptance criteria
3. Create implementation plan (phases, approach, risks, timeline)
4. Find the task database
5. Create individual tasks with properties and acceptance criteria
6. Link spec -> plan -> tasks bidirectionally
7. Track progress as implementation proceeds
