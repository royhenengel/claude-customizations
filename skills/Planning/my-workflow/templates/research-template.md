# {Feature Name} Research

## Problem Analysis

### Problem Domain

{Deep-dive into the problem space:
- What exactly are we solving?
- Why does this problem exist?
- Who experiences this problem and when?}

### Current State

{How is this handled today (if at all)?
- Existing workarounds
- Pain points with current approach
- What's missing}

## Information Gathered

### Codebase Analysis

- {Existing patterns discovered}
- {Related code that will be affected}
- {Conventions to follow}
- {Technical constraints from existing architecture}

### External Research

#### Ecosystem Overview

{Landscape of available solutions, tools, or approaches. What exists? What's mature vs emerging?}

#### Option Comparison

| Option | Type | Maturity | Complexity | Maintenance | Fit |
|--------|------|----------|------------|-------------|-----|
| A | {lib/pattern/approach} | {high/med/low} | {high/med/low} | {high/med/low} | {good/fair/poor} |
| B | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

#### Deep-Dive: {Selected Option}

{Detailed analysis of the recommended option:
- How it works
- Key features/capabilities
- Limitations and gotchas
- Community/support status}

## External Inspirations
