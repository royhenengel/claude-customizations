# Enhance RESEARCH.md Template Implementation Summary

**Completed**: 2026-02-03
**Plan**: planning/specs/enhance-research-template/PLAN.md

## What Was Built

Enhanced the RESEARCH.md template in the /plan workflow to guide deeper analysis, external learning, and structured decision-making. The template now includes comprehensive sections for problem analysis, external inspirations, tradeoff analysis, and architectural implications.

## Tasks Completed

- [x] Task 1: Update RESEARCH.md template in plan.md - Template replaced with enhanced version
- [x] Task 2: Verify template structure - User approved with 3 refinements

## Deviations

| Rule | What Happened | Resolution |
|------|---------------|------------|
| User Addition | User requested 3 refinements during verification: Key Decisions section, Open Questions list format, Sources dual-format | Applied via Gap Protocol (same feature enhancement) |

## Verification

- [x] plan.md contains updated RESEARCH.md template - PASSED
- [x] All discussed sections present - PASSED
- [x] Template is comprehensive but not overwhelming - PASSED (user approved)

## Files Changed

- `skills/my-workflow/workflows/plan.md` - Replaced RESEARCH.md template (lines 257-397)

## Template Sections

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Problem Analysis | Deep-dive problem domain and current state |
| Information Gathered | Codebase analysis + External Research with Ecosystem Overview, Option Comparison, Deep-Dive |
| External Inspirations | Sources Reviewed, Patterns, Problems & Solutions, Insights to Apply |
| Tradeoff Analysis | Factor/Choice/Alternative/Why table + Risks |
| Architectural Implications | System Boundaries, Dependencies, Integration Points |
| Approach | Chosen approach summary |
| Alternatives Considered | Options table with decision outcomes |
| Key Decisions | Sub-decisions made during research |
| Open Questions | List format |
| Sources | List for links, or table with context |

## Next Steps

- Use enhanced template in next /plan invocation
- Existing RESEARCH.md files remain valid (new sections are additive)
