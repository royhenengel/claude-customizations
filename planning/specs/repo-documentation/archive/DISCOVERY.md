# Repo Documentation Discovery (v2)

**Created**: 2026-02-08
**Updated**: 2026-02-08 (v2: expanded scope to cover full information architecture, memory vs docs, CLAUDE.md content, claude-code-prefs consolidation)

**Context**: During Task 4 (type system review) of the original plan, architectural questions surfaced that revealed gaps in the type system design. Scope then expanded to cover the full information architecture: all documents in docs/, the claude-code-prefs.md consolidation backlog item, memory vs docs delineation, and what CLAUDE.md should contain.

This file contains the full discovery analysis that led to 12 architectural decisions (Q1-Q12) documented in STATE.md and DISCOVERY.md Section 13.

See archive for full discovery document (file archived upon completion).
