## Status

All 12 architectural questions resolved (2026-02-10). PLAN.md is stale and needs full revision to reflect Q1-Q12 decisions before continuing execution. See planning/STATE.md "Decision Summary (Q1-Q12)" for the complete decision table. Key changes: rules/ directory using Anthropic's native ~/.claude/rules/ auto-loading, docs/ kept for catalogs, CLAUDE.md slimmed, claude-code-prefs decomposed, memory system delineation added to scope. Next action: revise PLAN.md.
